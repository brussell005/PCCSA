Week 8 Final
PCCSA

///////////////////// ///Azalea City CSA/// /////////////////////

*********************Ignore the MySql API folder included here and just use the Mysql-api link from the Final App Post. *********************I could not figure out how to remove it! Thanks!

---Purpose---

Semester Project creating a website that utilizes javascript, node.js, MySql, and Ajax


///NOTES///

//1// As of this version I have working Login, Logout, Register, AddItem, and DeleteItem functions. My layout needs a few tweaks with css and bootstrap. I'm not happy with the quantity functionality, but hoping to resolve that issue.

//2// Bootstrap was utilized through cdn where needed.

--------Instructions--------

a. Clone the PCCSA repo b. A download link will be also provided in my post for the mysql-api.
Create a MySql database named inventory.
Check the package.json for dependencies in both mysql-api and pccsa.
Run node src/index.js from mysql-api directory. (Runs at 3000)
Run node server/index.js from PCCSA directory. (Runs at 4000)
