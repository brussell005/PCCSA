---Purpose---

Semester Project creating a website that utilizes javascript, node.js, MySql, and more (in weeks to come)

As of this submission we are on Week4 and are implementing a log in and register function that interacts with our MySql dabatase. 

///NOTES///

//1// As of this version I have a working log in and register and my homepage points to a static inventory that is indicative of what my final product goal will look like. I want to have an inventory page of fruits and vegetables that display the quantity available, updating as the owner updates the inventory database. I believe I will be able to do this after week6's content. (AJAX?)

//2// Bootstrap was utilized through cdn where needed.


--------Instructions--------
1. Clone the PCCSA repo
2. Create a MySql database named inventory.
3. Check the package.json for dependencies in both mysql-api and pccsa.
4. Run node src/index.js from mysql-api directory. (Runs at 3000)
5. Run node server/index.js from PCCSA directory. (Runs at 4000)
